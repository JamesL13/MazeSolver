# MazeSolver
Maze Solver coded in C

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>This is the result of a school project where we were told to build a maze solving algorithm to find the shortest path.</p>

<h4>Aren't there already Shortest Path Algorithms?</h4>
<p>Well yes, but this is done in a slightly different way due to constraints such as
<li>The 'robot' can only move one space at a time</li>
<li>The 'robot' can not know the maze before entering it.</li>
<li>The 'robot' can not know where the end of the maze is.</li>
To accompany these restrictions I coded this program.
